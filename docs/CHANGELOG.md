### [2025-10-01] - Phase 2B: Temporal Multi-Worker Architecture üèóÔ∏è

#### Changed - Docker Networking
- **Removed custom bridge network** (`nabr-network`):
  - All services now use Docker Compose default network
  - Simplifies configuration without losing functionality
  - Services can still communicate via service names (e.g., `postgres`, `temporal`)
  - Docker Compose automatically creates a default network for the project
  - Reduced complexity while maintaining inter-service connectivity

#### Added - Temporal Workflow Infrastructure
- **Multi-Queue Worker Architecture** (following official Temporal best practices):
  - `verification-queue` - Two-party user verification workflows
  - `matching-queue` - Request-to-acceptor matching algorithms  
  - `review-queue` - Review submission and moderation
  - `notification-queue` - Email/SMS/push notifications
- **WorkerManager class** in `src/nabr/temporal/worker.py`:
  - Manages multiple workers with dedicated task queues
  - Shared ThreadPoolExecutor for sync activities (100 workers)
  - Supports running all workers in one process OR separate processes
  - Graceful shutdown handling with activity executor cleanup
  - Can start specific workers: `python -m nabr.temporal.worker verification`
- **SystemBootstrapWorkflow** - Temporal workflow for system initialization:
  - Runs database migrations via Alembic
  - Performs health checks on all services
  - Validates database schema integrity
  - Initializes default data if needed
  - Validates system configuration
  - Leverages Temporal's retry logic, error handling, and observability
  - Full audit trail in Temporal UI (http://localhost:8080)

  - Starts Temporal server (with SQLite persistence)
  - Starts PostgreSQL database
  - Runs bootstrap workflow via Temporal
  - Starts FastAPI backend
  - Starts Temporal workers (all or specific)
  - Options: `--skip-db` (use existing DB), `--dev` (workers in foreground)
  - Beautiful colored output with progress indicators
  - Health checks and service status reporting
- **`scripts/shutdown.sh`** - Graceful system shutdown:
  - Stops workers first (allows in-progress tasks to complete)

  - Now using domain-specific queues (verification-queue, etc.)
  - Maintained backward compatibility with old setting
- **Docker Compose** setup:
  - Worker container runs: `python -m nabr.temporal.worker`
  - Starts all workers in one container by default
  - Can be split into multiple containers for production scaling
  - Restart policy: `unless-stopped`

#### Architecture Benefits
- **Scalability**: Each worker type can scale independently

  - Shared client connection across all workers
  - `async with worker:` context manager pattern
  - Signal handling for graceful shutdown
- Following Temporal best practices from official docs:
  - Dedicated task queues per domain
  - Single worker process for simplicity (can split later)
  - Proper activity retry policies
  - Workflow determinism with `unsafe.imports_passed_through`
- Bootstrap workflow provides:
  - Automatic retries for transient failures
  - Full observability in Temporal UI

- Development mode available: `./scripts/startup.sh --dev`
- Bootstrap workflow visible in Temporal UI with ID: `system-bootstrap`
- Workers log to: `docker compose logs -f worker`
- Bootstrap workflow logs to: `logs/bootstrap.log`

### [2025-10-01] - Major Restructure: 3 User Types with Unique Workflows üîÑ

#### Breaking Changes
- **Removed "volunteer" user type** - System now supports only 3 user types: individual, business, organization
- **Replaced VolunteerProfile** with three separate profile models:
  - `IndividualProfile` - For community members (can request AND provide assistance)
  - `BusinessProfile` - For local businesses offering services/resources
  - `OrganizationProfile` - For non-profits and community groups
- **Removed background check fields** entirely for privacy compliance
- **Renamed request fields**:
  - `volunteer_id` ‚Üí `acceptor_id` (anyone can accept requests)
  - `num_volunteers_needed` ‚Üí `participants_needed`
  - Removed `required_certifications` field
- **Updated review types**:
  - `REQUESTER_TO_VOLUNTEER` ‚Üí `REQUESTER_TO_ACCEPTOR`
  - `VOLUNTEER_TO_REQUESTER` ‚Üí `ACCEPTOR_TO_REQUESTER`

#### Added - User Type Specific Profiles
- Created `IndividualProfile` model:
  - Fields: skills, interests, availability_schedule, max_distance_km (25km default)
  - Emergency contact fields (name, phone)
  - Languages spoken
  - Most flexible user type - can both request and provide assistance
- Created `BusinessProfile` model:
  - Fields: business_name, business_type, tax_id, website
  - Services offered and resources available (JSON arrays)
  - Business hours and service area radius (50km default)
  - Business license and insurance verification flags
- Created `OrganizationProfile` model:
  - Fields: organization_name, organization_type, tax_id, mission_statement
  - Programs offered and service areas (JSON arrays)
  - Staff count and volunteer capacity tracking
  - Non-profit status verification and accreditations

#### Changed - Database Schema
- Updated User model relationships:
  - Added `individual_profile`, `business_profile`, `organization_profile` relationships
  - Replaced `volunteer_profile` relationship
  - Changed `requests_claimed` ‚Üí `requests_accepted`
- Updated Request model:
  - `acceptor_id` foreign key replaces `volunteer_id`
  - `acceptor` relationship replaces `volunteer`
  - More generic terminology for flexible user types

#### Migration
- Generated migration `61358bb5b352_restructure_user_types_and_profiles`
- Applied migration successfully - tables restructured:
  - Dropped `volunteer_profiles` table
  - Created `individual_profiles` table
  - Created `business_profiles` table
  - Created `organization_profiles` table
  - Updated foreign keys and indexes in requests table

#### Updated - Authentication & API
- Updated registration endpoint to create appropriate profile based on user_type
- Removed volunteer-specific logic from auth routes
- Updated schema examples to show 3 user types (not 4)
- Updated model exports in `nabr.models.__init__`
- Fixed alembic env.py imports for new profile models

#### Documentation
- Created new README_NEW.md with:
  - Detailed description of each user type
  - Unique capabilities and workflows per type
  - Updated architecture documentation
  - Migration history
- Updated inline documentation in models
- Clarified user type purposes and separation

#### Security & Privacy
- **Removed all background check references** for privacy compliance
- Each user type has appropriate verification requirements:
  - Individuals: Two-party community verification
  - Businesses: Business license and insurance verification
  - Organizations: Non-profit status and accreditation verification

#### Rationale
- **User Type Clarity**: "Volunteer" was ambiguous - individuals can both give and receive help
- **Workflow Separation**: Each user type needs distinct workflows, dashboards, and features
- **Business Logic**: Businesses and organizations have fundamentally different needs than individuals
- **Privacy**: Background checks removed to reduce sensitive data storage
- **Scalability**: Separate profiles allow independent evolution of each user type's features

  - Public comments (visible to all)
  - Private comments (visible to participants and admins)
  - Detailed category ratings:
    - Professionalism
    - Communication
    - Punctuality
    - Skill level
  - Moderation flags
  - Verification linkage to completed requests
  - Temporal workflow integration

#### Enumeration Types Defined
- `UserType`: individual, volunteer, business, organization
- `VerificationStatus`: pending, verified, rejected, expired
- `RequestStatus`: pending, matched, in_progress, completed, cancelled, expired
- `RequestPriority`: low, medium, high, urgent
- `RequestType`: 10 categories covering common volunteer needs
- `ReviewType`: requester_to_volunteer, volunteer_to_requester

#### Architecture Decisions
1. **Async-First**: Using asyncio and async SQLAlchemy for scalability
2. **Type Safety**: Leveraging Python 3.13 type hints and Pydantic
3. **Security-First**: Enterprise-grade authentication and authorization
4. **Temporal Integration**: All processes orchestrated through Temporal workflows
5. **Privacy by Design**: Separate public/private data fields
6. **Audit Trail**: Immutable event logs for transparency
7. **Geographic Matching**: Built-in location support for proximity-based matching
8. **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns for maintainability
