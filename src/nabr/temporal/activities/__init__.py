"""
Temporal activities package for NƒÅbr workflows.

This package contains all activity implementations organized by domain.
Activities are the workhorses that perform actual work with side effects.

## Directory Structure:
- base.py: Base classes and utilities for all activities
- verification/: Modular verification activities (QR generation, authorization, trust scoring, etc.)
- matching.py: Request matching activities
- review.py: Review submission activities
- notification.py: Notification and communication activities
- database.py: Database operation activities

## Adding New Activities:
1. Create activity function with @activity.defn decorator
2. Add comprehensive docstring explaining purpose and parameters
3. Implement idempotent logic (safe to retry)
4. Add heartbeat for long-running operations
5. Handle cancellation gracefully
6. Return meaningful results
7. Add to appropriate module and __all__ list
