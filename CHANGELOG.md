## [Unreleased]

### [2025-10-01] - Phase 2A: FastAPI Application & Authentication System ✅

#### Added - FastAPI Main Application
- Created `src/nabr/main.py` with complete FastAPI application setup:
  - CORS middleware configuration for local development
  - Exception handlers for validation, database, and general errors
  - Lifespan context manager for startup/shutdown events
  - Database connectivity check on startup
  - Health endpoints: `GET /health` (service info), `GET /health/ready` (DB check)
  - Router registration for auth endpoints at `/api/v1` prefix
  - Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

#### Added - Authentication Dependencies
- Created `src/nabr/api/dependencies/auth.py` with JWT authentication:
  - `HTTPBearer` security scheme for token extraction
  - `get_current_user()` - Validates JWT, fetches user from database
  - `get_current_verified_user()` - Requires verified users only
  - `require_user_type()` - Factory for user-type-specific authorization
  - Comprehensive error handling for expired/invalid tokens

#### Added - Authentication Routes
- Created `src/nabr/api/routes/auth.py` with complete auth endpoints:
  - `POST /api/v1/auth/register` - User registration
    - Email validation with email-validator
    - Auto-generates username from email
    - Argon2 password hashing (OWASP recommended)
    - Creates VolunteerProfile for volunteer users
    - JSON-serialized arrays for skills/certifications
  - `POST /api/v1/auth/login` - User authentication
    - Returns JWT access token (30min expiry) + refresh token (7-day expiry)
    - Checks user is_active status
    - Validates credentials with Argon2
  - `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` - Token refresh
    - Validates refresh token type
    - Issues new token pair
  - `GET /api/v1/auth/me` - Current user information
    - Requires valid JWT Bearer token
    - Returns authenticated user details

#### Changed - Security Implementation
- Switched from bcrypt to Argon2 password hashing in `src/nabr/core/security.py`:
  - Reason: Bcrypt has 72-byte password limit, Argon2 is OWASP recommended
  - Configuration: m=65536, t=3, p=4 (memory-hard, resistant to GPU attacks)
  - Verified via Context7 documentation for Passlib and FastAPI best practices
- Updated `pyproject.toml` dependencies:
  - Added `argon2-cffi>=25.1.0` for password hashing
  - Added `email-validator` for Pydantic EmailStr validation

#### Added - Database Setup
- Initialized Alembic for database migrations:
  - Created `alembic/env.py` with async-to-sync URL conversion
  - Imports all models for autogeneration
  - Uses psycopg2 for sync migrations
- Generated and applied initial migration `6e9429e95787`:
  - Created `users` table with all fields including username
  - Created `volunteer_profiles` table with JSON-serialized arrays
  - Created `verifications` table for two-party verification
  - Created `requests` table for help requests
  - Created `request_event_logs` table for audit trail
  - Created `reviews` table for ratings/feedback
- Updated `alembic.ini` with `prepend_sys_path = src` for proper imports
- Created `.env` file with generated SECRET_KEY and database credentials
- PostgreSQL running in Docker container (nabr-postgres)

#### Fixed - Model Relationships
- Fixed SQLAlchemy relationship circular imports in `src/nabr/models/user.py`:
  - Used bracket syntax for forward references: `[Request.requester_id]`
  - Removed duplicate `verifications_received` relationship
  - Added username field as required, auto-generated from email
- Fixed VolunteerProfile field issues:
  - Removed non-existent `bio` field from profile creation
  - JSON-serialized skills/certifications arrays with `json.dumps([])`
  - Ensures PostgreSQL Text columns receive JSON strings, not Python lists

#### Testing
- Successfully tested all authentication endpoints:
  - ✅ User registration (volunteer and individual types)
  - ✅ User login with JWT token generation
  - ✅ Token refresh with new token pair
  - ✅ Current user endpoint with Bearer authentication
- Created test users:
  - Volunteer: newvolunteer@nabr.app (with VolunteerProfile)
